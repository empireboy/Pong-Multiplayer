# Pong Multiplayer
<!---
Hier komt een korte beschrijving van de proefopdracht. Wat heb je precies gedaan?
-->
It took me about two weeks to make this multiplayer version of a game called Pong. You can play it trough local and online. This is the first time I used Networking before in Unity.

## Software Analysis
The assignment stated that you had to use the Unity engine. I've been looking into multiple ways of creating an online multiplayer game. I had a strict deadline of 2 weeks, so I had to choose something that makes it easier to create an online multiplayer game.

- Unity

Unity has build-in components that make it easier to create an online multiplayer game. If I use Unity I can finish this project within 2 weeks.

- Unreal Engine

Unreal Engine also has build-in components that make it easier to create an online multiplayer game, but this will take way longer to learn.

- Phaser

There are libraries for phaser, but this will just take a little to long to sort out, and to try every library and what works functional.

- GameMaker

Networking is quiet easy if you use 39dll.dll or httpdll2. But you will need to port-forward if you want to be able to host a game.Not everyone understands how to do this. I will get this to work in time but it won't be easy for everyone to host a game. And also, most virus scanners will block incoming connection from GameMaker.

The most efficiant engine I could find is Unity or Unreal. Unreal will be great for networking, but I don't need something that is perfect right now, I need to be able to finish it in time, so I will work with the build-in components in Unity.

## Learning Goals
<!---
Wat wil je bereiken met dit project? Formuleer dit kort, krachtig en haalbaar.
- Het Flood-Fill algoritme snappen en toepassen
- Het ontwikkelen van een generieke FSM.
- etc. etc.
-->
- Understanding Networking in Unity.
- Creating a reusable UI system.
